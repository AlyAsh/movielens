This Movielens project was created to fulfill the requirements for completion
of the PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course offered by HarvardX on the 
online platform edx.org.

The project objective is to create a movie recommendation system using the 
MovieLens data set using the skills and tools learned throughout the 
Data Science Professional Certificate program.

Description of files:

download-data.R - provided by the Data Science: Capstone course, this loads the data and creates the validation set for the model
process-data.R - contains code that cleans the data before creating the training and test sets
analysis.R - first pass at improving the movie-and-user-effect model with regularization, resulting in RMSE 0.865
analysis-2.R and analysis-3.R (in progress) - continue exploring the effects of genre, time, number of movies, average rating, etc.
